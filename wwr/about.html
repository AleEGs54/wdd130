            <p>White Water Rafting, established in 1980 by John and Sarah Thompson, has been at the forefront of adventure tourism for over 40 years. 
                Starting with just a few rafts in the Rocky Mountains, the company quickly gained a reputation for providing safe and thrilling rafting
                experiences. Throughout the 1990s, White Water Rafting expanded its operations across North America, navigating rivers from the Grand Canyon 
                to the Smoky Mountains. Their innovative approach introduced specialized trips, catering to a wide range of adventurers from families to extreme 
                thrill-seekers.
